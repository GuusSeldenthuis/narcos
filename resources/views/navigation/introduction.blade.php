                <p>It’s 1972 you're 26 years old and you just woke up broke (<span aria-hidden="true" class="li_banknote"></span>) in the middle of Colombia (<span aria-hidden="true" class="li_location"></span>) carrying nothing (<span aria-hidden="true" class="li_truck"></span>) and no means to travel any faster around the globe (<span aria-hidden="true" class="li_world"></span>). In just six months time you wasted all your money on women, gambling and drugs. You’re the black sheep of the family with only limited work experience (<span aria-hidden="true" class="li_data"></span>) whatsoever. The only thing you got going is that you feel healthy (<span aria-hidden="true" class="li_heart"></span>).</p>
                <p>You’ll have to make up and due to stagnating economy of Colombia and the lack of any money makes you wonder about if there are other ways of making money.</p>
                <p>You're done with living the honest life. You want to make it big, you wanna be the king of coke.<br><br>You go out and seek some narcos…</p>

                <h5 class="text-secondary">Basics (how to)</h5>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <p>You need money to do anything in this game. And you'll need a lot of money to become an interesting person. Probably millions. Making a million here is as hard as it is in real-life, but don't let that discourage you. Get friends to play this game too and form a cartel. Together you're more powerful.</p>
                <p>Start off by committing trivial crimes this brings in some money. With money in the pocket you can do stuff. Focus on the banking, traveling, car theft and the map.</p>
                <p>
                    When you have a lot of money be sure to put it in the bank. This generates interest and will payout every 24hr. That's easy money. If you need to make the big bucks first do some drug trafficking instead. Buy in some narcotics low and travel to a country where they sell high. Another great way
                    to make some big bucks is to gather up some friends and organise crime. Organised crime pays out way better than trivial crimes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Invest in property if you can, whenever you see a piece of land up for purchase, buy it! On land you can build coca farms which in turn generate you narcotics. This means you won't have to buy in on narcotics, you just travel to the country where they sell high!
                </p>
                <p>If you don't feel like any of this, you could always wager a gamble. Seek out a numbers game or a roulette. Don't waste all your money on one play!</p>
                <p>Want to reduce your cooldowns (on all actions that generate money there's a cooldown, often a couple of minutes)? Go to the asset store and buy the quickest vehicle money can get.</p>
                <p>During this game you can end up in jail. Whenever this happens, it means you're outta play for a minute (or two). It does not mean you got banned, it's just part of the game.</p>
                <i>All assets taken? The next guy in line being weaker than you? Growing exponentially? Kill whoever is in your way, be wary though, it might just cost you your life. When you <b>die</b>, it's <b>game over</b>. You'll then need to start over again.</i>
